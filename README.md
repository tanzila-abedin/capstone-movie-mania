# REACT AND REDUX CAPSTONE : Movie Mania

I have built this React & Redux Capstone based on  a catalogue of statistics. Its a web app to fetch data from IMDB api to display list of popular movies and single page details about each of those movies. I have implemented  a search filter for the web app aswell.
